## Important Qualities in a Neighborhood  

Some qualities that make a neighborhood desirable include: safety, public schools, jobs, ease of transportation, nightlife, recreation, diversity, and affordability. The three most important qualities when choosing where to rent a room or apartment are **safety, ease of transportation, and recreation.** Since most people book an Airbnb for a short period of time, the qualities that are important differ from those for a long-term stay. For example, affordability, quality of public schools, and jobs (all of which are mentioned on Niche) are not as important. However, safety, transportation, and recreation are integral for a good Airbnb experience. Transportation especially is important in a city like New York and a borough like Brooklyn, as people often want to travel to Manhattan.
